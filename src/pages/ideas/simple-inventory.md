Inventory is annoying to manage. Players need to track the sometimes pages and pages of items they have or used.
This is both boring and extremely "metagamey." â€” So instead don't.

## A simpler inventory system

For simple things if within the fiction it makes sense that a character would have an item; they do. Simple as that.
This will remove alot of unnecessary inventory management but also will allow for more player creativity.
However players can't just have anything, aswell sometime the GM will invent an item for the players. For more complex items the rule is also simple when the table forgets about an item it is gone. This means in order to keep and item it must be constantly brought up and kept in the minds of the table, and therefore the fiction.
